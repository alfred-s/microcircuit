    8 populations are arranged in 4 layers, each containing an excitatory and 
    inhibitory population. Neuron and synapse numbers are estimated from 
    experimental data by Potjans and Diesmann. Synapses are drawn randomly until 
    a fixed number is reached. Both synapse weights and delays are drawn from Gaussian
    distributions. There's no plasticity. Each neuron receives independent Poissonian 
    spikes as input. Both spike times and membrane potentials are measured.

    Each spike of neuron $j$ elicits an exponentially decaying current in the
    postsynaptic neuron~$i$.  
    The amplitude is set by the synaptic weight $w_{ij}$. 
    The total incoming current is a sum over all synapses:
    \begin{equation}
        I_i(t) = 
            \sum_j w_{ij} \sum_k 
            \exp\left(\frac{t - t_j^k - d_{ij}}{\tau_\text{syn}}\right) ,
    \end{equation}
    where $t^k_j$ is the spike time of the $k$-th spike of neuron $j$.

\headerbox{MEAN FIELD THEORY}{name=meanfield, column=0, span=1, below=network}{
    The mean field model predicts firing rates for spiking network models of 
    leaky integrate-and-fire neurons (Equation \eqref{eq:lif-neuron}).
    For a sparsely connected network with uncorrelated input to each neuron, 
    the input current $I_i(t)$ to neuron $i$ in population $a$ can be described by 
    the stochastic equation
    \begin{align}
        \frac{\tau_\text{m}}{C_\text{m}} \, I_i(t) &= 
            \mu_a(t) + \sigma_a(t) \sqrt{\tau_\text{m}} \eta_i(t) \\
    \intertext{
    with average part $\mu$ and amplitude $\sigma$
    of the Gaussian white noise $\eta_i$ :
    }
        \mu_a        &= 
            \tau_\text{m}
            \sum_{b \,\in \text{pop.}} C_{ab} \, J_{ab} \, \nu_b +
            \tau_\text{m} C^\text{ext}_a J  \nu_\text{ext} 
            \, ; \\
        {\sigma_a}^2 &= 
            \tau_\text{m} 
            \sum_{b \,\in \text{pop.}} C_{ab} \, {J_{ab}}^2  \, \nu_b + 
            \tau_\text{m} C^\text{ext}_a J^{2} \nu_\text{ext} \,.
    \end{align}
    Transformation via
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 
        $\Rightarrow$ Fokker--Planck eq. for membrane potential distributions; 
        \item 
        $\Rightarrow$ stationary solution to Fokker--Planck eq.;
        \item 
        $\Rightarrow$ normalization condition for probability distributions
    \end{enumerate}
    leads to a self-consistency equation for the firing rates $\nu_a$ of each population:
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{1}{\nu_{a}} = \tau_{rp} 
            + \tau_\text{m} \sqrt{\pi}
            \int_{\frac{V_\text{r} - \mu_{a}}{\sigma_{a}}}^{\frac{\theta - \mu_{a}}{\sigma_{a}}} 
            e^{u^2} \left(1 + \text{erf}(u)\right) \diff u \,.
        \label{eq:self-consistency}
    \end{equation}
    The equations are coupled via the integral boundaries. Solutions are found
    numerically.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The mean field theory predicts firing rates and irregularity

        \item Deviations may be due to neglecting correlations.
        \item The theory can be applied as a convenient computational tool
            (large advantages in terms of computational time over simulations).

    * Synapses are modeled differently: 
    Whereas the spiking network model uses current based exponential synapses, 
    the mean field theory is originally developed for voltage based delta synapses.
    To include the difference, $J$ can be adapted.
