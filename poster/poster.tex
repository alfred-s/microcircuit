\begin{multicols}{2}
In Systems Biology, chemical reaction networks with a high number of species and a low number of observed quantities are very common. In addition, many measurement techniques like quantitative Western blot or protein arrays provide only relative data leading to undetermined scaling parameters in the mathematical model. This results in the problem of structural non-identifiability:  the effect of changing one parameter can be compensated by other parameters.

    \centerline{Global network structure}
    \vspace{0.2cm}
    8 populations are arranged in 4 layers, each containing an excitatory and 
    inhibitory population. Neuron and synapse numbers are estimated from 
    experimental data by Potjans and Diesmann. Synapses are drawn randomly until 
    a fixed number is reached. Each neuron receives independent Poissonian 
    spikes as input. Both spike times and membrane potentials are measured.

    Membrane potentials $V_i$ are modeled as an RC circuit:
        \begin{equation*}
            \tau_\text{m} \,\frac{\text{d} V_i(t)}{\text{d} t} 
                    = - V_i(t) + \frac{\tau_\text{m}}{C_\text{m}} I_i(t) \,.
        \end{equation*}
        If $V_i(t)$ reaches the threshold $\theta$: \\
        \vspace{0.2cm}
            \quad $\Rightarrow$ 
                Spike is emitted \\
        \vspace{0.2cm}

    \centerline{Current-based synapse model}
    \vspace{0.3cm}
    Each spike elicits a specific current in the postsynaptic neuron:
    \begin{equation*}
    I_{\text{syn}}(t) = w \exp{\left(\frac{-t}{\tau_\text{syn}}\right)}	\,.
    \end{equation*}
    The total incoming current is a sum over all synapses:
    \begin{equation*}
        I_i(t) = 
            \sum_j w_{ij} \sum_k 
            \exp\left(\frac{t - t_j^k - d_{ij}}{\tau_\text{syn}}\right)  \, ,
    \end{equation*}
    where $t^k_j$ is the spike time of the $k$-th spike of neuron $j$.

    \headerbox{MEAN FIELD THEORY}{name=meanfield, column=0, span=1, below=network}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    Based on Nicolas Brunel's mean field theory for two populations.
    For a sparsely connected network with uncorrelated input to each neuron, 
    the input current $I_i(t)$ to neuron $i$ in population $a$ can be described by 
    a stochastic equation:
    \begin{align*}
        \frac{\tau_\text{m}}{C_\text{m}} \, I_i(t) &= 
            \mu_a(t) + \sigma_a(t) \sqrt{\tau_\text{m}} \eta_i(t) \\
    \intertext{
    with average part $\mu$ and amplitude $\sigma$
    of the Gaussian white noise $\eta_i$ :
    }
        \mu_a        &= 
            \tau_\text{m}
            \sum_{b \,\in \text{pop.}} C_{ab} \, J_{ab} \, \nu_b +
            \tau_\text{m} C^\text{ext}_a J  \nu_\text{ext} 
            \, ; \\
        {\sigma_a}^2 &= 
            \tau_\text{m} 
            \sum_{b \,\in \text{pop.}} C_{ab} \, {J_{ab}}^2  \, \nu_b + 
            \tau_\text{m} C^\text{ext}_a J^{2} \nu_\text{ext} \,.
    \end{align*}
    Transformation via
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 
        $\Rightarrow$ Fokker--Planck eq. for membrane potential distributions; 
        \item 
        $\Rightarrow$ Stationary solution to Fokker--Planck eq.;
        \item 
        $\Rightarrow$ Normalization condition for probability distributions;
    \end{enumerate}
    leads to a self-consistency equation for the firing rates $\nu_a$ of each population:
    \begin{equation*}
        \frac{1}{\nu_{a}} = \tau_{rp} 
            + \tau_\text{m} \sqrt{\pi}
                \int_{\frac{V_\text{r} - \mu_{a}}{\sigma_{a}}}^{\frac{\theta - \mu_{a}}{\sigma_{a}}} 
                    e^{u^2} \left(1 + \text{erf}(u)\right) \diff u  
    \end{equation*}
    The equations are coupled via the integral boundaries. Solutions are found
    numerically.

* Synapses are modeled differently: 
Whereas the spiking network model uses current based exponential synapses, 
the mean field theory is originally developed for voltage based delta synapses.
To include the difference, $J$ can be adapted.
