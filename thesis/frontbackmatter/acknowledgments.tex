\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I am indebted to Stefan Rotter and Benjamin Merkt for introducing 
me into the fascinating field of computational neuroscience, always
being open for questions and triggering most fruitful discussions. I further want
to thank Jens Timmer for his supervision. Finally, I am grateful for the support 
of both my family and friends, without which this work would not have been possible.
