HYPOTHESES

- The original model can be implemented in PyNEST, yielding a 
comprehensible structure.

- Some of the results of Potjans' model can be approximated with a 
mean field theory (most notably, firing rates and membrane potential
distributions).

\emph{Biology -> questions -> models / simulation -> mean field}


Biology
Neocortex: 
enable higher cognitive function
six-layered organization, 
regionalization into areas 
(sensory, motor, associative)
\cite{lui2011development}
microcircuit
signal processing: input to layer IV, ...
rates, oscillations

Connectivity map
local connectivity data (different animals, different methods)
long range neglected

Spiking network model
leaky integrate and fire neuron
Dale's principle
current based synapses
sparse random connectivity: network characterized by few parameters
NEST
reproduces rates

Mean field
analytical framework

underlying questions: 
    what drives the network?
    is it stable?
    can / are information processed via rates?

more technical:
    can measures of data from spiking network simulations be predicted?
    is this a useful tool for exploring states of the network?

origin:
series of papers by Brunel, culminating in a central paper: Brunel2000 
prework: Tuckwell, Risken 


%It remains unclear, however, 
%how far these results can be applied to more complex networks, containing 
%larger number of populations. This study sets out to address these questions. 


The thesis is structured as follows. The first section contains a detailed account 
of the spiking network model as well as a derivation of the mean field model 
for eight populations.  
The results are then presented starting by comparing the simulation results to 
those of the implementation of the original paper by Potjans and 
Diesmann~\cite{potjans2014} as well as a closer look on the statistical properties 
of a number of measures. This is followed by comparing simulation results to those
obtained with the mean field model. In order to assess the differences between 
predicted and measured quantities, 
Further simulations with parameters adjusted 
to the mean field model are evaluated, 
\\\emph{showing the strong/weak dependence on the assumptions made for the mean
field theory.}
