    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{\figdir population_activity}
    \caption{Population activity of all eight populations.
        (A) Number of spikes per 1 ms over the time of 1 s;
        (B) Power spectral density (PSC) of population activity minus mean activity. 
        Lighter and heavily oscillating background is the complete PSD, thick darker 
        line represents filtered data (Savitzky-Golay filter of 5th degree over 301 data points).
        The peaks indicate global oscillations at $\approx 82$ Hz (origin not clear).

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{\figdir transition_mf_vs_model}
    \caption{Transition from Brunels model of equal populations to the neocortical network model. 
        Single neuron firing rates obtained by simulation (dotted lines) and 
        numerical solution of the mean field model. Distance $d$ indicates the 
        normalized $L^2$-norm in the parameter space ($8 \times 8$ synapse numbers $+ j_{02}$, see text
        for further explanation).
