\section{Appendix A: Source code}
The source code of the figures is excluded here in order to focus on the relevant algorithms; 
The figures used in the report are merely a visualization of the calculations. The full programs can
be reviewed at a github server~\cite{ba_github} or more conveniently with the \textit{ipython notebook viewer} 
\cite{notebook_viewer}.
