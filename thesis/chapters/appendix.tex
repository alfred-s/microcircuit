\section{Appendix A: Source code}
We excluded the source code of the figures here in order to focus on the relevant algorithms; 
The figures used in the report are merely a visualization of the calculations. The full programs can
be reviewed at our github server~\cite{ba_github} or more conveniently with the \textit{ipython notebook viewer} 
\cite{notebook_viewer}.
