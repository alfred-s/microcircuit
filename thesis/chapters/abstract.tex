\section{Abstract}
\label{abstract}
Although many efforts have been undertaken in recent years, the 
local neocortical microcircuit remains to be only superficially 
understood. This is the case both for its function and its structure, 
and much more so for the relation of the two. 

A full-scale spiking network model was established by Potjans and 
Diesmann \cite{potjans2014} in 2014 in order 
to examine the gap between connectivity data and measured spike rates
in awake animals.

In this thesis, the corresponding model is reimplemented and analyzed. 
A mean-field theory is developed to predict the rates of the model
based on self-consistency in a equilibrium state. This approach is based 
on the theory developed by Brunel in 2000 \cite{brunel2000}.
